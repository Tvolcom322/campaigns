### Teyluu

#### Background:
Almost 1400 years ago the world known as Faerun was rewritten. The land masses changed by the power of gods, and the established cities of power and splendor were casualties of great conflict. The hubris of the Kings and Queens of Faerun bred ill-content and condemnation from various pockets in the world, til groups clashed and sought powers the knew not how to control. Deities, never meant to share our plane, were summoned and used as tools of determent and rights of rule. 
Raegiir, King of Amn, replacement of the Council of Six, gained support from Lord Ao, the Being of Light. 
Ralan Pesarkhal, King of Calimshan won the favor of Grumbar, the God of Elemental Earth and Oaths, and etugen, Grumbars aspect who was regarded as goddess of earth, pastures, and herds. 
Yaevet, Queen of Chessenta, was guided by Lathander, the God of Spring, youth, birth, and vitality. 
Strenton, King of Chondath, formed alliances with Waukeen, Goddess of Trade, and Malar, the God of the Hunt. 
And lastly Queen Xiadorma of Damara won over Talos, God of Storms, and Tempus, God of War and warriors.

Soon, all the Monarchs had at least one God or Goddess on their side, as they eyed one another on who would make the first move. But an outside group, known only as The Memorum, unleashed three gods unto the world. Bane, the Black Lord, God of hatred, fear, and Tyranny. Cyric, God of Murder, Lies, and Deception. and Lolth, Goddess of Drowm Spiders, Chaos and Evil. Together, they caused destruction, havoc and reaping fear amongst the Monarchs. They started fighting each other, thinking their rivals had finally started the battle. Towns were devastated, armies became irrelevant. Only champions so bold, and the deities and their blessings mattered now. After a month of war, the Monarchs wanted a truce and to rebuild as one kingdom, as none were in a condition to survive anymore. When the accord was to be made however, The Memorum struck, unleashing the three Deities aligned with their cause again in a coordinated attack. All the Monarchs were slain, their pacts broken with their Deities, who then retreated to their respective Planes. And the Memorum were never seen again. For another year the world would continue to be a dangerous place. Seas rising, Mountains crumbling and Volcanoes releasing their fury. By the time the world was calming, three cities of notoriety rose. Umbra in the new continent of Calimsar, Presido, in the old land of Amn, and Gassiron in Damara. As time would march forward, so would the cycle repeat itself. Cities expanded and boundaries were drawn. But the largest a war would progress in 1000 years would be 3 battles long with 600 casualties. Each year that progressed promised for the past to be forgotten more and more. Outside city walls or cleared areas the world remained dangerous however. Ancient magic lingers in the world, and nobody knows all of what is out there.

### The Spire

#### Background:
The Spire is a school for learning magic and martial skills to better be suited to serving the people or improving the practices. It is very exclusive for entering, as it requires the approval of both headmasters who seek talent, potential, and intrigue. It is a tall tower for its main building, with a large yard outside of it called the Court, and a centered circular area outside the front of The Spire floored with tan bricks called the Yard. Its front gate connects to the main road of Bridgetown, a business center that revels in being connected to the Spire, as they provide services to The Spire in exchange for assistance with personal requests from the students. All of this rests above a bay of ocean on a column of rock connected only by the arch of Bridgetown. There are more columns with smaller buildings that connects to the Spire, but this houses residential and recreational buildings for students and visitors. The Spire consists of where classes are held. It is a 7 story tall spire, and the column it rests on is 600 ft above water level.

#### Hierarchy:
Hierarchy of the residents rank in order of Fletchling, Sparrow, Hawk, Eagle, Headmaster.

* Fletchling is a new tryout who must pass their final evaluation after 3 years study or be asked to leave the university and return to retry in a year, but only needing to repeat the last year they did instead of all 3.

* Sparrows have passed their exams and are considered full student and or graduates of The Spire. Them and any level above them are considered graduates of The Spire. They are recognized by their Bronze rings on their right Ring finger.

* Hawks are like professors, they oversee the continued education and or training of Sparrows. They have a minimum of 5 years field experience and have been recognized by the Headmasters by recommendation from an Eagle. They are recognized by Silver rings on their right Middle finger.

* Eagles are heads of departments within The Spire. The choose which requests to accept from civilians, budgeting of various sorts for the school at large, and have been recognized and promoted to their positions by the Headmaster's themselves. They adorn Gold Rings on their right Index finger.

* Headmasters are the top of the food-chain of the school. They have final say on any matter they see the need to weigh in on and spend their days observing students and counseling with Hawks and Eagles on curriculum. The are the public speakers for The Spire when needs arise, and handle their unique political placement of a land within Presidio but outside the reach of Queen Hauvreigha. They wear one of each ring along with a Black ring that is on their thumb. Ido wears his on his left, and Iro on his right.

There are other staff as well, who work at the spire outside any sort of academic purpose. A quartermaster, a cleric, a clerk, 2 cooks, 3 groundskeepers, a librarian, and a harbormaster. Each of these people hire off and on as the season demands of course. sometimes students, sometimes from Bridgetown, and sometimes as a favor to somebody coming to seek experience from them and they were able to convince them to be given a shot. Additionally at times new faces can be seen for a month or 2 at a time assisting the headmasters as errand runners but they never stay on school grounds.

There are plenty of laws for grounds of The Spire, but some are unique to get you expelled. 
Of course there are normal laws of not killing or stealing, but those are more laws of the land that are just upheld.

### Studies:
As students of the Spire, it is important to keep a grasp of your studies when you can. Using either the Library or books you obtain or check out, you can train skills in preperation for tests. In order to study a skill, it needs to be the only skill you work on for a full week, meaning you cannot switch the skill you start studying for 10 days.

You must accumulate 8 hrs worth of studying within a day, with a minimum of 2 straight hours for them to count. If you do not reach the 8 hour mark within a day, then half of your hours rounded down will carry over to the next day. When you successfully study for at least 8 hours within a day you gain a Study Point in the skill you have been studying. At 5 Study Points, you can attempt a d20 roll; if you roll an 18-20, you gain a Misc. +1 bonus to that skill. Whether successful or not, Study Points reset after an attempted roll.

The only 2 skills that are separate from this method of studying is Acrobatics and Athletics. These two skills can be trained in tandem with all the other skills within a week. You earn hours towards these skills by spending time in the Sparring Grounds, or by training in your environment.

While studying, you are not fully at rest despite it being reading, so you cannot benefit from a long or short rest. That being said you can only study a maximum of 12 hours in a day (for character realism sake of breaks). Characters can experience burnout from studying as well however. Every consecutive day spent studing past 3 raises a chance to have study efforts be ineffective. Each day past the third you need to roll a d20 and pass the DC for whatever number day is shown to a maximum of 7 days and then they must take a break. A break may not be spent to switch to training another skill or studying as the case may be.

| Day  |  DC   |
|------|-------|
|   4  |  3    |
|   5  |  7    |
|   6  |  11   |
|   7  |  16   |

Sometimes you can find rare oppurtunities or texts that can help further your normal studying method such as special lectures or rare texts.

### Tests:
At the end of a month, (30 days), students have a test held at The Spire to measure the performance of each of your skills. You will attempt a roll with each skill, and your collective results determine your grades. However, you must also get at least passing with more than half of your skills (10 of them).

| DC   | Grade |
|------|-------|
| <7   | F=1   |
| ~7   | D=2   |
| ~10  | C=3   |
| ~14  | B=4   |
| ~17  | A=5   |
| ~22  | A+=6  |

Your monthly grades determine if you gain any points to spend around for school services and perhaps even a discount on your tuition.

All of your grades are tallied up into an average which determines your outcome.

| Grade | Outcome                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| F     | Owe an extra 200 gold or 2 points for tuition |
| D     | Owe an extra 100 gold or 1 point for tuition  |
| C     | Gain 1 Spire Credit                           |
| B     | Gain 2 Spire Credits                          |
| A     | Gain 3 Spire Credits                          |

### Artificer:
The artificer’s services are up for graduated students. Every new graduate is allowed a maximum of 2 items to be improved as a graduation gift. Any further improvements require points or gold. Each point is the equivalent of 100 gold when it comes to enchantments. Prices are normally rounded up for uneven amounts, but the Artificers have been known to allow a smidge of haggling.

### Quartermaster:
The Quartermaster can get his hands on anything and everything; "I just need the time", he claims. From weapons, armor, materials, and equipment, he will do all he can to find it. A request from the quartermaster costs 1 point if it is something not mundane as determined by the DM, provided he doesn’t already have what you seek. The cost of your quarry is its normal price supplemented with 5 extra gold pieces.

### Library:
The Library provides an excellent place to study and explore for information of the land. The Spire also has exclusive texts, requiring a fee in exchange for a chance to acquire some of their knowledge. For 1 point, a student may, with supervision, read and choose 1 exclusive text in the field of a skill for a day. An exclusive text takes 3 days to finish, or 2 if you have proficiency in linguistics. When you finish reading a text, your next Studies roll you perform to attempt for a Misc. bonus will have an increased range of 14-20 instead of the normal 18-20 until you succeed at it. 

### Harbor:
Students now have the option to store vessels in the harbor at the cost of 1 point per month. Each student may only store 1 vessel at a time, and said vessel must fit within the dock's parameters (25’ across maximum).

### Sparring Grounds:
The Sparring Grounds is where one goes to train their more physical skills (Acrobatics and Athletics). Additionally, you can coordinate to have team spars with other classmates at this location. Wagers of credits or gold can be made if you can convince your opponents to place a bet, provided you have such currency to wager. Credits can only be exchanged between students with authority of an eagle to complete the transaction.

### Bridgetown:
Lots of the citizens of Bridgetown depend on students as an occasional workforce. You can take jobs from them for the day and earn gold as a reward. You may roll a d20, with a DC of 20 minus the number of skills your are proficient in, to try and find yourself a job. [Ex: if you are proficient in 4 skills, your DC is 16]. If you take on a job you are not proficient in, you will earn 10+1d10 gold. If you are proficient in the job, you will earn 20+1d20 gold.

### Laboratory:
Students who are proficient in Biology or Herbology may use the laboratory to expend their ingredients in order to make potions or medicine. If you do not have the means or ingredients, services of the Lab may be purchased from the Laboratory as well. Supplies are often limited, so the Laboratory will sometimes send requests to The Spire in order to replenish their stock.
