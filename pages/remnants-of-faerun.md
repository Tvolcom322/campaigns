### Teyluu

#### Background:
Almost 1400 years ago the world known as Faerun was rewritten. The land masses changed by the power of gods, and the established cities of power and splendor were casualties of great conflict. The hubris of the Kings and Queens of Faerun bred ill-content and condemnation from various pockets in the world, til groups clashed and sought powers the knew not how to control. Deities, never meant to share our plane, were summoned and used as tools of determent and rights of rule. 
Raegiir, King of Amn, replacement of the Council of Six, gained support from Lord Ao, the Being of Light. 
Ralan Pesarkhal, King of Calimshan won the favor of Grumbar, the God of Elemental Earth and Oaths, and etugen, Grumbars aspect who was regarded as goddess of earth, pastures, and herds. 
Yaevet, Queen of Chessenta, was guided by Lathander, the God of Spring, youth, birth, and vitality. 
Strenton, King of Chondath, formed alliances with Waukeen, Goddess of Trade, and Malar, the God of the Hunt. 
And lastly Queen Xiadorma of Damara won over Talos, God of Storms, and Tempus, God of War and warriors.

Soon, all the Monarchs had at least one God or Goddess on their side, as they eyed one another on who would make the first move. But an outside group, known only as The Memorum, unleashed three gods unto the world. Bane, the Black Lord, God of hatred, fear, and Tyranny. Cyric, God of Murder, Lies, and Deception. and Lolth, Goddess of Drowm Spiders, Chaos and Evil. Together, they caused destruction, havoc and reaping fear amongst the Monarchs. They started fighting each other, thinking their rivals had finally started the battle. Towns were devastated, armies became irrelevant. Only champions so bold, and the deities and their blessings mattered now. After a month of war, the Monarchs wanted a truce and to rebuild as one kingdom, as none were in a condition to survive anymore. When the accord was to be made however, The Memorum struck, unleashing the three Deities aligned with their cause again in a coordinated attack. All the Monarchs were slain, their pacts broken with their Deities, who then retreated to their respective Planes. And the Memorum were never seen again. For another year the world would continue to be a dangerous place. Seas rising, Mountains crumbling and Volcanoes releasing their fury. By the time the world was calming, three cities of notoriety rose. Umbra in the new continent of Calimsar, Presido, in the old land of Amn, and Gassiron in Damara. As time would march forward, so would the cycle repeat itself. Cities expanded and boundaries were drawn. But the largest a war would progress in 1000 years would be 3 battles long with 600 casualties. Each year that progressed promised for the past to be forgotten more and more. Outside city walls or cleared areas the world remained dangerous however. Ancient magic lingers in the world, and nobody knows all of what is out there.

### The Spire

#### Background:
The Spire is a school for learning magic and martial skills to better be suited to serving the people or improving the practices. It is very exclusive for entering, as it requires the approval of both headmasters who seek talent, potential, and intrigue. It is a tall tower for its main building, with a large yard outside of it called the Court, and a centered circular area outside the front of The Spire floored with tan bricks called the Yard. Its front gate connects to the main road of Bridgetown, a business center that revels in being connected to the Spire, as they provide services to The Spire in exchange for assistance with personal requests from the students. All of this rests above a bay of ocean on a column of rock connected only by the arch of Bridgetown. There are more columns with smaller buildings that connects to the Spire, but this houses residential and recreational buildings for students and visitors. The Spire consists of where classes are held. It is an 7 story tall spire, and the column it rests on is 220 ft above water level.

#### Hierarchy:
Hierarchy of the residents rank in order of Fletchling, Sparrow, Hawk, Eagle, Headmaster.

* Fletchling is a new tryout who must pass their final evaluation after 3 years study or be asked to leave the university

## Spire Services & Mechanics

### Studies:
When your character dedicates a day to studies, they may choose a single subject on the skills in your character sheet. Only one skill type can be studied each week, while that skill may be studied for more than a single day. Each day you study earns a point towards that skill. At 5 points, you can attempt a d20 roll, and on a 19 or 20, you gain a +1 in Misc. Bonus to that skill.  Studies cannot take place during a long rest where you are recovering Hit Points or Spell slots Acrobatics and Athletics are not viable skills to study in this matter. They require use of the Sparring Grounds.

### Tests:
At the end of a month, (30 days), students have a test held at The Spire to measure the performance of each of your skills. You will attempt a roll with each skill, and your collective results determine your grades. However, you must also get at least passing with more than half of your skills (10 of them).

| DC   | Grade |
|------|-------|
| <10  | F     |
| ~10  | D     |
| ~13  | C     |
| ~18  | B     |
| ~22  | A     |

Your monthly grades determine if you gain any points to spend around for school services and perhaps even a discount on your tuition.

All of your grades are tallied up into an average which determines your outcome.

| Grade | Outcome                                       |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| F     | Owe an extra 200 gold or 2 points for tuition |
| D     | Owe an extra 100 gold or 1 point for tuition  |
| C     | Nothing happens                               |
| B     | Gain 2 points                                 |
| A     | Gain 3 points                                 |

### Artificer:
The artificer’s services are up for graduated students. Every new graduate is allowed a maximum of 2 items to be improved as a graduation gift. Any further improvements require points or gold. Each point is the equivalent of 100 gold when it comes to enchantments. Prices are normally rounded up for uneven amounts, but the Artificers have been known to allow a smidge of haggling.

### Quartermaster:
The Quartermaster can get his hands on anything and everything; "I just need the time", he claims. From weapons, armor, materials, and equipment, he will do all he can to find it. A request from the quartermaster costs 1 point, provided he doesn’t already have what you seek. The cost of your quarry is its normal price supplemented with 5 extra gold pieces.

### Library:
The Library provides an excellent place to study and explore for information of the land. The Spire also has exclusive texts, requiring a fee in exchange for a chance to acquire some of their knowledge. For 1 point, a student may, with supervision, read and choose 1 exclusive text in the field of a skill for a day. An exclusive text takes 3 days to finish, or 2 if you have proficiency in linguistics. When you finish reading a text, your next Studies roll you perform to attempt for a Misc. bonus will have an increased range of 14-20 instead of the normal 19-20 until you succeed at it. 

### Harbor:
Students now have the option to store vessels in the harbor at the cost of 1 point per month. Each student may only store 1 vessel at a time, and said vessel must fit within the dock's parameters (25’ across maximum).

### Sparring Grounds:
The Sparring Grounds is where one goes to train their more physical skills (Acrobatics and Athletics). Additionally, you can coordinate to have team spars with other classmates at this location. Wagers of points or gold can be made if you can convince your opponents to place a bet, provided you have such currency to wager.

### Bridgetown:
Lots of the citizens of Bridgetown depend on students as an occasional workforce. You can take jobs from them for the day and earn gold as a reward. You may roll a d20, with a DC of 20 minus the number of skills your are proficient in, to try and find yourself a job. [Ex: if you are proficient in 4 skills, your DC is 16]. If you take on a job you are not proficient in, you will earn 10+1d10 gold. If you are proficient in the job, you will earn 10+1d20 gold.

### Laboratory:
Students who are proficient in Biology or Herbology may use the laboratory to expend their ingredients in order to make potions or medicine. If you do not have the means or ingredients, services of the Lab may be purchased from the Laboratory as well. Supplies are often limited, so the Laboratory will sometimes send requests to The Spire in order to replenish their stock.
